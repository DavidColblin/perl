How To Install Perl on a WAMP Server

Step 1:

Download and install WAMP server (WampServer), default installation is c:\wamp. Installing WampServer is not in the scope of this, “how to”. You can read my article on WAMP vs. IIS for a better understanding of WAMP.

Step 2:

Download and install Active Perl from http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads/ ; based on this tutorial, download the Windows Installer (MSI). Run the installer;
Click Next on the first screen, “Using ActivePerl at work?”. 
Read and accept license agreement, hit next.
Custom setup screen, choose browse and install it in c:\wamp\bin\Perl\. click next, and keep all the following defaults, and finally install it. It will take some time to install depending on your computer.
And finally once installed, uncheck, Display the release notes, and click finish.

I chose the installation directory c:\wamp\bin\Perl\, to keep consistency for all apache related applications.

Step 3:

Verify the installer actually wrote the PATH variable in your system. This will save you a lot of headaches. Right click on “My Computer”, select properties, select Advanced Properties, click on Environmental Variables and under System variables scroll down and double click on PATH and verify c:\wamp\bin\Perl\site\bin; is in the Variable value.

Or simply open a command prompt, start> run> cmd> and type:
prompt>perl -v

It should spit out the version of the perl your running.

Step 4:

Configure httpd.conf on WAMP server (WampServer) for perl. Open C:\wamp\bin\apache\Apache2.2.11\conf\httpd.conf, file which is your apache configuration file.
Look for, Directory “c:/wamp/www/”, and under this line look for and replace:
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks

with:
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI

This will activate Perl for your WAMP server (WampServer), so you can run Perl scripts.
Look for and replace:
#AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

with:
AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
AddHandler cgi-script .pl

This will activate the AddHandler for cgi and pl. These are common, so enable them.
Look for and replace:
DirectoryIndex index.php index.php3 index.html index.htm

with:
DirectoryIndex index.php index.php3 index.html index.htm index.cgi index.pl

Apache executes these in the respective order; if it doesn’t find index.php it will look for index.php3 than index.html and so on. 

Step 5:

Restart WAMP server (WampServer) apache service. Wampserver > Apache > Service > Restart Service. Your server is ready to run, Perl. You can test by downloading this file and placing into one of your development site, c:/wamp/www/dev-site.com/perl-stuff, and executing it via browser, i.e. http://dev-site.com/perl-stuff.
